How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories gives perspective from the user's point of view which makes it a great tool for feedback. After interpreting a user story you can decipher what the user is trying to accomplish and align development towards solution or minimize any pain points. After addressing the user's goals and needs testers can use acceptance criteria to ensure any added features work as intended.


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In my future projects I will take what I learned from Scrum and Agile and I will start by breaking down big projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. I will prioritize development based on user value and business impact and I will continously test and gather feedback to adjust as quick as possible. The processes that I will use will include: Sprint planning
Daily Standups
Backlog Refinement
Retrospectives

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member it is important to communicate effectively. Share updates early, and ask for clarity. Another way is to remain supportive of team members changes in requirement can happen at any time adapting to these changes and following through with task is a great way to be a good team member, Agile's structure relies on the strength of teams.
